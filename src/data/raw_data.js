The government in We is way less sinister than 1984 and you could really even argue that it's ultimate goal was the flourishing of the people under its rule. It's easy to denounce the overreach and crimes of Big Brother, but in a culture driven by rapidly advancing knowledge and sheer amounts of data, are we as willing to admit to ourselves that those will ultimately fail as our saviors as well?<br/><br/>Also, while it made parts of this book tough to follow, the jagged, frantic writing in parts really works well.",,,,,,0,,,,,

I had to restart a couple of them multiple times after realizing my mind wandered for a few sentences and was completely lost.<br/><br/>But they are very good. I think the best part of Marilynne Robinson's writing is that she doesn't really make assumptions about the topic she's writing about. Most writers you could probably assume, based on your knowledge of who they are, what their ultimate point about a topic would be. That only partially works with her. Most times she ends up in the general vicinity of where you think she'd go, but often takes a different path to get there, or ends up slightly left or right where you think she'd land.<br/><br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

I suspect it will last for about a month...</i><br/><br/>This is one of the books that seemingly everybody put on their best-of-2015 list, so I picked it up. I'm not planning on ever writing a memoir, and I'm not super drawn to the genre in particular, though I think I'll maybe read more memoirs after reading this book.<br/><br/>There were parts that were too how-to that I just wasn't interested in. I also felt many of Karr's references to other memoir authors assumed too much familiarity from the reader. (The chapter on the one author I HAD read, Vladimir Nabokov, was unbelievably spot-on though).<br/><br/>Apart from those 2 things, this book was great. Karr really understands the way humanity derives both meaning and connection from personal narrative, both through telling one's own and hearing other people tell theirs. She also addresses the difficulty and almost universal phenomena of misremembering and reinterpreting, feeling shame from the uglier parts, and the feeling of inadequacy when comparing yourself to others; all things that anybody, memoirist or not, can relate to.<br/><br/>",,,,,,0,,,,,

(Side note: Goodreads needs to handle rereads better. And by ""better"" I mean ""at all""). I could probably read this every year and still love it. The scope of this book is breathtaking to have been written by a single individual. It's hard to imagine a world in which Dostoevsky's piercing insight into humanity isn't relevant.<br/><br/>The thing I wish I knew about this book while reading it last year is that the plot is subservient to the characters. Not necessarily that it's less important or any less interesting, but Dostoevsky spends the first 200ish pages largely on character development. (I also wish I'd read about how Russian names work because it feels like there's 30 characters immediately, but there's really like 6 and they're all calling each other 5 different things). Rereading this, I realized how unbelievably well and distinctly Dostoevsky voices his characters, which is huge with the overall message and themes in Brothers Karamazov.",,,,,,0,,,,,
