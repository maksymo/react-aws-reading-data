There's no plot. The structure is strange. It's one of these things with lots of ambiguity and endless \"Wait, what is he actually trying to say here\" moments.<br/><br/>Cities are generally fascinating to me and I’ve read a handful of nonfiction books about them, but none of them have exemplified how cities play a part in our personal narratives, our relationship to the physical space of a city, and our relationship to each other better than this book.",

       "My Review": "First read this about 5 years ago and it holds up pretty well to a re-read. <br/><br/>I think what I really like about this book is that, unlike a lot of stuff in the true crime genre, it's less about the whodunnit (you know from basically the first chapter) and more about developing the people who are involved. So often this kind of stuff tries hook you with emotions and preys on a desire to know juicy details (looking at you, Serial Season 1). <br/><br/>Capote does a great job of holding both the senselessness and harrowing nature of the murder and the humanity of the perpetrators without downplaying either. At the end of the book, you both realize that they absolutely deserve their fate, but you still care about them as people and empathize with the paths that led them to that point.",

       "My Review": "I really went back and forth on whether or not to give this 4 stars, but think I'm sticking with 3.<br/><br/>First, the good: <br/>Sekeran is a very talented writer. This book is long and doesn't move super fast, but it never felt like it dragged. <br/><br/>There are sides in this story, both it isn't a good vs. bad setup, and it's done very effectively. Both sides are allowed to develop and I actually felt torn with how I wanted it to end. It was a good reminder that wherever you align politically on immigration / adoption, it involves human life<br/><br/>The things I didn't like as much:<br/>The husband's plot line just doesn't do it for me, and felt really distracting. Stories about belonging, home, and motherhood have been told, and will continue to be told, for millennia. Will we continue to tell stories about workaholic bosses and tech companies in Silicon Valley? (I hope not) <br/><br/>The last 20ish% felt way too rushed compared to the first 80%. It just felt like there was some obligation to have something quick and interesting happen. The writing was good enough to continue a slower burn and hold some ambiguity, which feels like it'd be truer to reality. <br/>",

(Also it's very short and I had fallen behind on my reading goal)<br/><br/>Ultimately thought the plot line that led to the ending just sort of fell flat. Also there's a substantial amount of random detail that felt like distracting filler.",

Palmer's search for the demolished houses that were part of her childhood growing up in the shadow of the Atlanta airport underscores the impact on human lives that \"progress\" has on cities. <br/><br/>There's no shortage of conversations about the tension of gentrification and revitalization in Atlanta, but none of them seem to touch the area around the airport. It was cool to see a book on this area",

       "Exclusive Shelf": "read  'Dostoevsky wants us to choose that humanity will survive - not merely as a biological but a cultural reality. And the culture he identifies as human is one in which we do not have to lie about what we are in relationship to our environment; a culture that insists upon a recognition of mortality and fallibility, of limit, of mutual indebtedness for our nurture and psychological growth, of the inaccessibility of our souls to one another and of the gratuitous and creative nature of what we say to one another. His fictions tell us, with intensifying urgency, that this culture is more at risk than we might have thought, that the restless concerns of secular and instrumentalist thinking are fast eroding it, so that we may wake up and discover we no longer know how to respond with either respect or compassion to each other, and so have literally nothing to say'<br/><br/> This is a dense book and a parts of it went way over my head, but really does a fantastic job of getting to the core of why Dostoevsky's ideas will always be relevant.

       "My Review": "Again with the dead Russians, Nathan. <br/><br/>Tolstoy is just so good at characters and their relationships to others and the world that they inhabit. While Dostoevsky is a master at confronting the dark fringes of humanity lurking deep in the soul, Tolstoy prefers a more optimistic, life-affirming arena that never feels naive or artificial. These stories stories (though at least 2 of them could be considered novellas) are an awesome way of experiencing Tolstoy without having to commit to the marathon of Anna Karenina or War & Peace.",

       "My Review": "I heard somebody on a podcast talking about this book and their comment was something to the effect of \"Marilynne Robinson is a brilliant thinker, but I don't think I'd want to get a beer with her\". <br/><br/>Spot on.<br/><br/>These essays are dense.  I had to restart a couple of them multiple times after realizing my mind wandered for a few sentences and was completely lost.<br/><br/>But they are very good. I think the best part of Marilynne Robinson's writing is that she doesn't really make assumptions about the topic she's writing about. Most writers you could probably assume, based on your knowledge of who they are, what their ultimate point about a topic would be. That only partially works with her. Most times she ends up in the general vicinity of where you think she'd go, but often takes a different path to get there, or ends up slightly left or right where you think she'd land.<br/><br/>",

       "My Review": "Pretty sure this was a recommendation at the end of \"How to Read Literature Like A Professor\", and it's pretty obvious why. Lots of really great allegory throughout. Most of which I probably missed. <br/><br/>I guess I could see how people would think this is boring. Not much actually <i>happens<\/i>. But really great complex characters and relationships.<br/>",

       "My Review": "I absolutely devoured this book. The characters are complex. The writing is breathtaking. It felt like the shortest 650+ page book I've ever read. You should read it.<br/><br/>\"But why only 3 stars???\" you ask... (mild spoilers for a predictable and absolutely terrible plot point ahead)<br/><br/>Tom and Susan's \"extracurricular\" activity is so unbelievably stupid and unnecessary. It felt like it was put in there because the masses need some sort of juicy love interest to keep them interested. Take that entire arc out of it and I'd probably give this 5 stars.",

       "My Review": "Really fun read! Everybody has been comparing this to the Martian, which makes sense. It's a little more dark and less humorous than the Martian, but told in a similar way with the interview style / log entries. Kind of thought the ending wasn't as exciting as the rest of the book, which in the end felt like a setup for the next book in the series. Looking forward to the next one when it comes out next Spring though. ",

       "My Review": "One of those rare theology books that perfectly straddles the line between academic and practical. Jones takes a deep look at a number of different aspect of Christ, ranging from his humanity to the names used for him throughout the Bible to the miracles he performed while on Earth. While each chapter is basically a deep (and often fresh) theological treatise on an aspect of Christ, each chapter also does an excellent job of answering the \"So What?\" questions that inevitably arise from deep theological study.<br/><br/>BONUS: Most of these chapters are really short, so it's a great daily read even if you're pressed for time",

Arranged in the order in which he wrote them, most of the the earlier ones are 1 or 2 page character sketches and it's interesting to see how his writing progressed as he grew older.",

Sure, it resonates at the same frequency as the current zeitgeist, but seeing so many people use words like \"important\" and \"necessary\" is really baffling. <br/><br/>The thing about satire is that it can quickly become a one trick pony. This book does. Quickly. So instead of things like, oh, I don't know...plot...it's basically filled with a bunch of loud, raunchy jokes with some other stuff happening on the side. Which is fine for something like a standup comedy show, but not \"important\" and \"necessary\" books.",

But I stuck with it and really ended up enjoying it (and the author did end up explaining everything...I think...). Like all the best sci-fi, it makes us ask questions about what it means to be human. Specifically, The Thing Itself deals with humans' search for objective truth with a consciousness that is anything but objective. Interestingly, Roberts (an atheist) says in the acknowledgements that his goal was to write a book making the case for why someone should believe in God, which I think is a really fascinating thought experiment.",

       "My Review": "One wonders if \"War and Peace\" would has been as highly acclaimed as it was if it was published under it's original name \"War---What Is It Good For?\" <br/><br/>Not really sure if you can say anything that hasn't been said about an iconic 147 year-old book. <br/><br/>The only thing really daunting about this book is the physical size (and the nearly 600 named characters). Once you get started (and print out a character list explaining the relationship between the main characters), it's a phenomenal read that is pretty easy to get through, but still carries emotional weight. I always find it so fascinating that books written so long ago in a vastly different culture can still be so incredibly relevant. Sure, there's a bunch of stuff in War and Peace about the glory and future of \"Mother Russia\", but beneath all of that is a meditation on what motivates and moves humanity to action.",

       "My Review": "Really solid 30,000 ft view of church history. Obviously trying to distill so much into a little less than 600 pages is going to simplify events and leave much out, but there's a list of further reading for each chapter which I will probably use for a few reads in the future. I thought Shelley's style and writing were very well done and remained engaging throughout the book. The chapters were also fairly short, making this a pretty easy daily read",

I also wish the author had included a chapter dedicated to global warming instead of inserting it as an aside in so many places, which ended up feeling a little preach'y.  ",

       "My Review": "Exceptional group of stories but, man, they're not for those wanting a sunny view of life. It's hard to separate the gritty bleakness of Pancake's writing with the tragic story of his life. <br/><br/>The real strength of these stories is how completely dialed in to the heartbeat of rural West Virginia Pancake is. There's always seems to be a standard set of ideals that accompany the songs and stories of Appalachia: the geography, moving away, coming back, the comfort of family, the pain of family, the people you grew up with, the woes of blue collar work, etc. All of these themes run through these stories, creating characters and settings that are honest and captivating.<br/><br/>",

       "My Review": "Marilynne Robinson's work reads like literary comfort food to me. It's not super flashy. There's honestly not a whole lot that usually happens. Her characters can seem a little awkward at times. But there's something in those qualities that really makes me really enjoy her writing. There's a simplicity in it that doesn't sacrifice depth or quality of writing. She also does one of the best jobs of showing an honest representation of faith that isn't cheesy or preachy. <br/><br/>Of the 3 books in the Gilead trilogy, Gilead is still probably my favorite. This one is second with Home coming in 3rd. ",

I just don't think this is the best way to read him. This is most or all of his stories put into a book so some of the stories are incredible while some are a struggle to get through. I also think his style of writing just works best with longer works where you don't have to constantly have to reacquaint yourself with characters and plots so often, and you have time to marinate in the brilliancy of his prose.",

I suspect it will last for about a month...<\/i><br/><br/>This is one of the books that seemingly everybody put on their best-of-2015 list, so I picked it up. I'm not planning on ever writing a memoir, and I'm not super drawn to the genre in particular, though I think I'll maybe read more memoirs after reading this book.<br/><br/>There were parts that were too how-to that I just wasn't interested in. I also felt many of Karr's references to other memoir authors assumed too much familiarity from the reader. (The chapter on the one author I HAD read, Vladimir Nabokov, was unbelievably spot-on though).<br/><br/>Apart from those 2 things, this book was great. Karr really understands the way humanity derives both meaning and connection from personal narrative, both through telling one's own and hearing other people tell theirs. She also addresses the difficulty and almost universal phenomena of misremembering and reinterpreting, feeling shame from the uglier parts, and the feeling of inadequacy when comparing yourself to others; all things that anybody, memoirist or not, can relate to.<br/><br/>",

Instead of just a chronological history of the banjo, the author presents the banjo always in the context of whatever era she was current discussing. It did tend to be pretty academic in places, which always seems to lead to reductive or overly simplistic conclusions when talking about something like folk music, but overall I enjoyed how well researched the book was ",

Still, Dostoevsky's brilliant insight into the inner workings of humanity is still there, and it's easy to see experiences that led to many of the themes he explores in his later works. Certain parts are also incredibly relevant to many of the conversations taking place about incarceration happening today.",
